[00:50.82] I survived
[00:53.50] All the crazy things you gave
[00:55.92] n every mess that was ever made
[01:00.45] You are mine
[01:02.90] I call your name and you will
[01:05.46] Be on time
[01:07.20] Living in this small world and its
[01:10.08] Future's bright
[01:12.49] Brighter than my ceiling lights
[01:14.62] n sweeter than my mother's cream pie
[01:20.48] Follow my tender heart and I'll win
[01:24.84] No matter what pain I am in
[01:29.84] With all your blessings I'll arise
[01:35.50] Open up my third eye

[02:16.46] Finalized
[02:18.46] We got each other always
[02:21.39] Fantasized
[02:23.55] Surely knew we could do it
[02:25.98] I decide
[02:27.83] Every day I meditate
[02:30.01] And make every action a prayer
[02:36.31] Filling my heart with your affection
[02:41.40] Being your best friend is my devotion
[02:46.26] Calling your name is my surrender
[02:51.28] Babe, I got your number
[03:14.50] Filling my heart with your affection
[03:19.19] Being your best friend is my devotion
[03:24.08] Calling your name is my surrender
[03:29.66] Babe, I got your number
[03:32.15] Prema
[03:34.37] Don't u know that I am love itself
[03:38.16] I am love itself
[03:42.15] Prema
[03:44.07] Can't u see that I am god itself
[03:47.51] I am god itself
